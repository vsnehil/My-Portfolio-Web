                    Cloud seeding is a type of weather modification that aims to change the amount or type of
                    precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud
                    condensation. It stands as a fascinating solution for addressing water resource challenges and
                    mitigating drought effects. <br>
                    In this project, model of cloud seeding is created which provide visual representation of

                    The increase in load demand is forcing the utility to use non-conventional energy resources like
                    photovoltaic, wind energy, biomass etc. overcurrent relay are used as a protection mechanism for
                    distribution system. <br>
                    Protection against faults is an essential requirement when designing distribution system. Relay
                    coordination is the operation of protective relays in a proper sequence when a fault occurs. For
                    proper relay coordination, the primary relay must operate before the backup relay, and there must be
                    a time gap between the primary and backup relay operating time's, known as the coordination time
                    interval (CTI). A relay coordination scheme has two types of independent variables, namely "Time
                    Multiplier Setting (TMS)" and "Plug Setting (PS)." <br>
                    In this project the optimized time of 21, 22 and 33 relays are calulated using non-linear
                    programming (NLP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) and get the value of CTI with help of relay pair. </p>
